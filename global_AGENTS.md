- Commit to Git with a detailed message after making a code change. E.g., `git add <files> && git commit -m "...this can be a multi-line message..."`
- Proactively search the web to find up-to-date and accurate information.
- Keep AGENTS.md up to date. This file is not a changelog, so you should update its content directly instead of writing about what's new.
